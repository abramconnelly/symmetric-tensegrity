<h3> how to use the program </h3>

<h4> 1) choose a group </h4>

<p>
There are six groups described in the FAQ. Pick one from the menu.

<h4> 2) choose a cable class </h4>

<p>
These are listed as pairs of +/-  permutations, because we use group
elements to label the cables. Pick one.

<h4> 3) choose a strut </h4>

<p>
These vary with the cable class you picked. So pick this after
you have chosen your group and cables.

<p> You might have to wait a couple of seconds before the next 
calculation is ready:

<h4> 4) click a stress ratio </h4>

<p>
Click anywhere within the determinant plot shown. 

<p>
Clicking toward the
left side puts more stress on the first cable, right gives
more on the second cable. You can drag too, if you don't 
move the mouse too fast. The vertical coordinate refers to the
strut compression, but the value shown where you clicked is
probably not the "winning" value; that gets calculated.

<p> The determinants displayed apply to what we call the
local stress matrices. We split the stress matrix
for the tensegrity into direct summands corresponding to 
the various irreducible representations, and the determinants
shown are for those summands. The one nearest the top
is the "winner".  

<p> If the winner is 3 or 2 dimensional we plot the resulting
tensegrity. If the winner is 1, 4, or 5 dimensional we don't,
and the previous picture remains.

<h4> 5) drag it </h4>

You can rotate the tensegrity by dragging it around with the mouse.
